# Newsletter Management App 
This repository contains my solution for a university project: a newsletter management application written entirely in Bash & Python. 

## What I Learned

**Shell Scripting** – Applied my theoretical shell scripting knowledge to create an interactive application.\
**Menus with Whiptail** – Built a visually appealing interface with Whiptail for managing subscribers, sending/editing mails, and handling admin settings.\
**Project Design** – Organized functionality into modular scripts (`abonati.sh`, `newsletter.sh`, `admin.sh`) for better structure and maintainability.\
**CLI Linux** - Became more comfortable with CLI Linux, as this program was entirely written on Ubuntu Server.
